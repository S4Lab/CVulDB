    tilegx: enable SYSCALL_WRAPPERS support
    
    commit e6d9668e119af44ae5bcd5f1197174531458afe3 upstream.
    
    Some discussion with the glibc mailing lists revealed that this was
    necessary for 64-bit platforms with MIPS-like sign-extension rules
    for 32-bit values.  The original symptom was that passing (uid_t)-1 to
    setreuid() was failing in programs linked -pthread because of the "setxid"
    mechanism for passing setxid-type function arguments to the syscall code.
    SYSCALL_WRAPPERS handles ensuring that all syscall arguments end up with
    proper sign-extension and is thus the appropriate fix for this problem.
    
    On other platforms (s390, powerpc, sparc64, and mips) this was fixed
    in 2.6.28.6.  The general issue is tracked as CVE-2009-0029.
