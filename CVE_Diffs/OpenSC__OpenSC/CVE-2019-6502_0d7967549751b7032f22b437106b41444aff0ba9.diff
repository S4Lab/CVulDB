    Small memory leak fix (CVE-2019-6502 in #1586)
    
    CVE-2019-6502 was assigned to what appears to be a very minor
    memory leak that only occurs on an error-case in a CLI tool.
    If util_connect_card fails, we still need to release the sc
    context previously allocated by sc_context_create else memory
    will leak.
