    UPSTREAM: KEYS: close race between key lookup and freeing
    
    (cherry pick from commit a3a8784454692dd72e5d5d34dcdab17b4420e74c)
    
    When a key is being garbage collected, it's key->user would get put
    before the ->destroy() callback is called, where the key is removed from
    it's respective tracking structures.
    
    This leaves a key hanging in a semi-invalid state which leaves a window
    open for a different task to try an access key->user. An example is
    find_keyring_by_name() which would dereference key->user for a key that
    is in the process of being garbage collected (where key->user was freed
    but ->destroy() wasn't called yet - so it's still present in the linked
    list).
    
    This would cause either a panic, or corrupt memory.
    
    Fixes CVE-2014-9529.
