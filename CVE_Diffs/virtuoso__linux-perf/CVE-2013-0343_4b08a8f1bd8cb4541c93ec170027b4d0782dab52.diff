    ipv6: remove max_addresses check from ipv6_create_tempaddr
    
    Because of the max_addresses check attackers were able to disable privacy
    extensions on an interface by creating enough autoconfigured addresses:
    
    <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2012/q4/292>
    
    But the check is not actually needed: max_addresses protects the
    kernel to install too many ipv6 addresses on an interface and guards
    addrconf_prefix_rcv to install further addresses as soon as this limit
    is reached. We only generate temporary addresses in direct response of
    a new address showing up. As soon as we filled up the maximum number of
    addresses of an interface, we stop installing more addresses and thus
    also stop generating more temp addresses.
    
    Even if the attacker tries to generate a lot of temporary addresses
    by announcing a prefix and removing it again (lifetime == 0) we won't
    install more temp addresses, because the temporary addresses do count
    to the maximum number of addresses, thus we would stop installing new
    autoconfigured addresses when the limit is reached.
    
    This patch fixes CVE-2013-0343 (but other layer-2 attacks are still
    possible).
