    MFV r337818:
    
    WPA: Ignore unauthenticated encrypted EAPOL-Key data
    
    Ignore unauthenticated encrypted EAPOL-Key data in supplicant
    processing. When using WPA2, these are frames that have the Encrypted
    flag set, but not the MIC flag.
    
    When using WPA2, EAPOL-Key frames that had the Encrypted flag set but
    not the MIC flag, had their data field decrypted without first verifying
    the MIC. In case the data field was encrypted using RC4 (i.e., when
    negotiating TKIP as the pairwise cipher), this meant that
    unauthenticated but decrypted data would then be processed. An adversary
    could abuse this as a decryption oracle to recover sensitive information
    in the data field of EAPOL-Key messages (e.g., the group key).
    (CVE-2018-14526)
