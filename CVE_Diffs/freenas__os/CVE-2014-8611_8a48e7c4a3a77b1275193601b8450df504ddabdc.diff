    In r268924 __fflush was modified so that when write(2) was not successful,
    _p and _w are adjusted to account for the partial write (if any).
    
    However, _p and _w should not be unconditionally adjusted and should only
    be changed when we actually wrote some bytes, or the accumulated accounting
    error will eventually result in a heap buffer overflow.
