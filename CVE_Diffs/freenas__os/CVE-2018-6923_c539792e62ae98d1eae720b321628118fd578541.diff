    MFC r337775:
      Improve hashing of IPv4 fragments.
    
      Currently, IPv4 fragments are hashed into buckets based on a 32-bit
      key which is calculated by (src_ip ^ ip_id) and combined with a random
      seed. However, because an attacker can control the values of src_ip
      and ip_id, it is possible to construct an attack which causes very
      deep chains to form in a given bucket.
    
      To ensure more uniform distribution (and lower predictability for
      an attacker), calculate the hash based on a key which includes all
      the fields we use to identify a reassembly queue (dst_ip, src_ip,
      ip_id, and the ip protocol) as well as a random seed.
