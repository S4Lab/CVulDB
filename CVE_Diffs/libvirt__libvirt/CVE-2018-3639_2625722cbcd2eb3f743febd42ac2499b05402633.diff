    cpu: add 'amd-ssbd' and 'amd-no-ssb' CPU features (CVE-2018-3639)
    
    AMD x86 CPUs have two separate ways to mitigate the Speculative Store
    Bypass hardware flaw. In current processors only non-architectural MSRs
    are available, and so hypervisors must expose a virtualized MSR and CPU
    flag "virt-ssbd" (CPUID Function 8000_0008, EBX[25]=1).
    
    In future processors AMD will provide an architectural MSR, indicated by
    existance of the CPUID Function 8000_0008, EBX[24]=1, to which QEMU has
    given the name "amd-ssbd".
    
    The "amd-ssbd" flag should be used in preference to "virt-ssbd", if it
    is available, since it provides improved performance. For virtual
    machine configuration, both should be exposed when available, to allow
    for maximal guest OS compatibility as not all guests yet support both.
    
    If future processes are not vulnerable to the flaw, this will be
    indicated by the existance of CPUID Function 8000_0008, EBX[26]=1,
    to which QEMU has given the name "amd-no-ssb".

      https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199889
    
    Note that neither amd-ssbd or amd-no-ssb will be reported by the kernel
    in /proc/cpuinfo. It knows about these CPUID bits and does the right thing,
    but doesn't report their existance as distinct flags in /proc/cpuinfo.
