    splice: Apply generic position and size checks to each write
    
    3.2.67-rc1 review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.
    
    ------------------
    
    From: Ben Hutchings <ben@decadent.org.uk>
    
    We need to check the position and size of file writes against various
    limits, using generic_write_check().  This was not being done for
    the splice write path.  It was fixed upstream by commit 8d0207652cbe
    ("->splice_write() via ->write_iter()") but we can't apply that.
