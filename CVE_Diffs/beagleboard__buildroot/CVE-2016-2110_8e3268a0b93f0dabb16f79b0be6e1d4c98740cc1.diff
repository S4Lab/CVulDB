    samba4: security bump to version 4.4.2
    
    Fixes:
    
    CVE-2016-2118 - A man in the middle can intercept any DCERPC traffic
    between a client and a server in order toimpersonate the client and get
    the same privileges as the authenticated user account.
    
    CVE-2016-2115 - The protection of DCERPC communication over ncacn_np
    (which is the default for most the file server related protocols) is
    inherited from the underlying SMB connection. Samba doesn't enforce SMB
    signing for this kind of SMB connections by default, which makes man in
    the middle attacks possible.
    
    CVE-2016-2114 - Due to a bug Samba doesn't enforce required smb signing,
    even if explicitly configured.
    
    CVE-2016-2113 - Man in the middle attacks are possible for client
    triggered LDAP connections (with ldaps://) and ncacn_http connections
    (with https://).
    
    CVE-2016-2112 - A man in the middle is able to downgrade LDAP
    connections to no integrity protection. It's possible to attack client
    and server with this.
    
    CVE-2016-2111 - When Samba is configured as Domain Controller it allows
    remote attackers to spoof the computer name of a secure channel's
    endpoints, and obtain sensitive session information, by running a
    crafted application and leveraging the ability to sniff network traffic.
    
    CVE-2016-2110 - The feature negotiation of NTLMSSP is not downgrade
    protected. A man in the middle is able to clear even required flags,
    especially NTLMSSP_NEGOTIATE_SIGN and NTLMSSP_NEGOTIATE_SEAL.
    
    CVE-2015-5370 - Errors in Samba DCE-RPC code can lead to denial of
    service (crashes and high cpu consumption) and man in the middle
    attacks.
