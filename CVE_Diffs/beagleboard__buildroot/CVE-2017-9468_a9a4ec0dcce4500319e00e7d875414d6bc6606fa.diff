    irssi: security bump to version 1.0.5
    
    Fixes the following security issues:
    
    (a) When installing themes with unterminated colour formatting
        sequences, Irssi may access data beyond the end of the
        string. (CWE-126) Found by Hanno BÃ¶ck.
    
        CVE-2017-15228 was assigned to this issue.
    
    (b) While waiting for the channel synchronisation, Irssi may
        incorrectly fail to remove destroyed channels from the query list,
        resulting in use after free conditions when updating the state
        later on. Found by Joseph Bisch. (CWE-416 caused by CWE-672)
    
        CVE-2017-15227 was assigned to this issue.
    
    (c) Certain incorrectly formatted DCC CTCP messages could cause NULL
        pointer dereference. Found by Joseph Bisch. This is a separate,
        but similar issue to CVE-2017-9468. (CWE-690)
    
        CVE-2017-15721 was assigned to this issue.
    
    (d) Overlong nicks or targets may result in a NULL pointer dereference
        while splitting the message. Found by Joseph Bisch. (CWE-690)
    
        CVE-2017-15723 was assigned to this issue.
    
    (e) In certain cases Irssi may fail to verify that a Safe channel ID
        is long enough, causing reads beyond the end of the string. Found
        by Joseph Bisch. (CWE-126)
    
        CVE-2017-15722 was assigned to this issue.
    
    For more details, see the advisory:

    While we're at it, also add a hash for the license file.
