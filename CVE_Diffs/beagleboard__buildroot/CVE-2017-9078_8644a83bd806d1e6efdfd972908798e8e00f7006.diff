    dropbear: security bump to version 2017.75
    
    Fixes:
    
    - CVE-2017-9078: A double-free in the server could be triggered by an
      authenticated user if dropbear is running with -a (Allow connections to
      forwarded ports from any host) This could potentially allow arbitrary code
      execution as root by an authenticated user.  Affects versions 2013.56 to
      2016.74.  Thanks to Mark Shepard for reporting the crash.
    
    - CVE-2017-9079: Dropbear parsed authorized_keys as root, even if it were a
      symlink.  The fix is to switch to user permissions when opening
      authorized_keys.
      A user could symlink their ~/.ssh/authorized_keys to a root-owned file
      they couldn't normally read.  If they managed to get that file to contain
      valid authorized_keys with command= options it might be possible to read
      other contents of that file.  This information disclosure is to an already
      authenticated user.  Thanks to Jann Horn of Google Project Zero for
      reporting this.
