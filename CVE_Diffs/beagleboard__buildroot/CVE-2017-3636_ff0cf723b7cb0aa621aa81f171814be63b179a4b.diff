    Release notes: https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-10126-release-notes/
    Changelog: https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-10126-changelog/
    
    Fixes the following security vulnerabilities:
    
    CVE-2017-3636 - Vulnerability in the MySQL Server component of Oracle MySQL
    (subcomponent: Client programs). Supported versions that are affected are
    5.5.56 and earlier and 5.6.36 and earlier. Easily exploitable vulnerability
    allows low privileged attacker with logon to the infrastructure where MySQL
    Server executes to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this
    vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to
    some of MySQL Server accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to
    a subset of MySQL Server accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause
    a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of MySQL Server.

    (subcomponent: Server: DML). Supported versions that are affected are
    5.5.56 and earlier, 5.6.36 and earlier and 5.7.18 and earlier. Easily
    exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with network
    access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful
    attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause
    a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server.
    
    CVE-2017-3653 - Vulnerability in the MySQL Server component of Oracle MySQL
    (subcomponent: Server: DDL). Supported versions that are affected are
    5.5.56 and earlier, 5.6.36 and earlier and 5.7.18 and earlier. Difficult
    to exploit vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access
    via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks of
    this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete
    access to some of MySQL Server accessible data.
