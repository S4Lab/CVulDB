    samba4: security bump to version 4.6.11
    
    Fixes the following security issues:
    
     - CVE-2017-14746:
       All versions of Samba from 4.0.0 onwards are vulnerable to a use after
       free vulnerability, where a malicious SMB1 request can be used to
       control the contents of heap memory via a deallocated heap pointer. It
       is possible this may be used to compromise the SMB server.
    
     - CVE-2017-15275:
       All versions of Samba from 3.6.0 onwards are vulnerable to a heap
       memory information leak, where server allocated heap memory may be
       returned to the client without being cleared.
    
       There is no known vulnerability associated with this error, but
       uncleared heap memory may contain previously used data that may help
       an attacker compromise the server via other methods. Uncleared heap
       memory may potentially contain password hashes or other high-value
       data.
