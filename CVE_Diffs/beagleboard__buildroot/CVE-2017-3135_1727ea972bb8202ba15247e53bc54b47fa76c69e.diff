    bind: bump version to 9.11.0-P5 (security)
    
    Security Fixes:
     - rndc "" could trigger an assertion failure in named. This flaw is
       disclosed in (CVE-2017-3138). [RT #44924]
     - Some chaining (i.e., type CNAME or DNAME) responses to upstream
       queries could trigger assertion failures. This flaw is disclosed in
       CVE-2017-3137. [RT #44734]
     - dns64 with break-dnssec yes; can result in an assertion failure. This
       flaw is disclosed in CVE-2017-3136. [RT #44653]
     - If a server is configured with a response policy zone (RPZ) that
       rewrites an answer with local data, and is also configured for DNS64
       address mapping, a NULL pointer can be read triggering a server
       crash. This flaw is disclosed in CVE-2017-3135. [RT #44434]
     - A coding error in the nxdomain-redirect feature could lead to an
       assertion failure if the redirection namespace was served from a
       local authoritative data source such as a local zone or a DLZ instead
       of via recursive lookup. This flaw is disclosed in CVE-2016-9778.
       [RT #43837]
     - named could mishandle authority sections with missing RRSIGs,
       triggering an assertion failure. This flaw is disclosed in
       CVE-2016-9444. [RT #43632]
     - named mishandled some responses where covering RRSIG records were
       returned without the requested data, resulting in an assertion
       failure. This flaw is disclosed in CVE-2016-9147. [RT #43548]
     - named incorrectly tried to cache TKEY records which could trigger an
       assertion failure when there was a class mismatch. This flaw is
       disclosed in CVE-2016-9131. [RT #43522]
     - It was possible to trigger assertions when processing responses
       containing answers of type DNAME. This flaw is disclosed in
       CVE-2016-8864. [RT #43465]
