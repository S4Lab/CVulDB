    mariadb: security bump to version 10.1.23
    
    Fixes:
    
    CVE-2017-3302 - Crash in libmysqlclient.so in Oracle MySQL before 5.6.21 and
    5.7.x before 5.7.5 and MariaDB through 5.5.54, 10.0.x through 10.0.29,
    10.1.x through 10.1.21, and 10.2.x through 10.2.3.
    
    CVE-2017-3313 - Vulnerability in the MySQL Server component of Oracle MySQL
    (subcomponent: Server: MyISAM). Supported versions that are affected are
    5.5.53 and earlier, 5.6.34 and earlier and 5.7.16 and earlier. Difficult to
    exploit vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with logon to the
    infrastructure where MySQL Server executes to compromise MySQL Server.
    Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access
    to critical data or complete access to all MySQL Server accessible data.
    
    CVE-2017-3308 - Vulnerability in the MySQL Server component of Oracle MySQL
    (subcomponent: Server: DML). Supported versions that are affected are 5.5.54
    and earlier, 5.6.35 and earlier and 5.7.17 and earlier. Easily "exploitable"
    vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via
    multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. While the vulnerability is
    in MySQL Server, attacks may significantly impact additional products.
    Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
    ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of
    MySQL Server.
    
    CVE-2017-3309 - Vulnerability in the MySQL Server component of Oracle MySQL
    (subcomponent: Server: Optimizer). Supported versions that are affected are
    5.5.54 and earlier, 5.6.35 and earlier and 5.7.17 and earlier. Easily
    "exploitable" vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network
    access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. While the
    vulnerability is in MySQL Server, attacks may significantly impact
    additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result
    in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash
    (complete DOS) of MySQL Server.
    
    CVE-2017-3453 - Vulnerability in the MySQL Server component of Oracle MySQL
    (subcomponent: Server: Optimizer). Supported versions that are affected are
    5.5.54 and earlier, 5.6.35 and earlier and 5.7.17 and earlier. Easily
    "exploitable" vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network
    access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks
    of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or
    frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server.
    
    CVE-2017-3456 - Vulnerability in the MySQL Server component of Oracle MySQL
    (subcomponent: Server: DML). Supported versions that are affected are 5.5.54
    and earlier, 5.6.35 and earlier and 5.7.17 and earlier. Easily "exploitable"
    vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with network access via
    multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this
    vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or
    frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server.
    
    CVE-2017-3464 - Vulnerability in the MySQL Server component of Oracle MySQL
    (subcomponent: Server: DDL). Supported versions that are affected are 5.5.54
    and earlier, 5.6.35 and earlier and 5.7.17 and earlier. Easily "exploitable"
    vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via
    multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this
    vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to
    some of MySQL Server accessible data.
    
    And a number of important, but non-security related fixes:
    
    MDEV-12602: Fixed some race conditions in InnoDB encryption
    
    MariaDB Backup alpha introduced
    
    Galera wsrep library updated to 25.3.20
