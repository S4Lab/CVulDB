    CVE-2014-4877: Arbitrary Symlink Access
    
    Wget was susceptible to a symlink attack which could create arbitrary
    files, directories or symbolic links and set their permissions when
    retrieving a directory recursively through FTP. This commit changes the
    default settings in Wget such that Wget no longer creates local symbolic
    links, but rather traverses them and retrieves the pointed-to file in
    such a retrieval.
    
    The old behaviour can be attained by passing the --retr-symlinks=no
    option to the Wget invokation command.

-Usually, when retrieving @sc{ftp} directories recursively and a symbolic
-link is encountered, the linked-to file is not downloaded.  Instead, a

-pointed-to file will not be downloaded unless this recursive retrieval
-would have encountered it separately and downloaded it anyway.

-When @samp{--retr-symlinks} is specified, however, symbolic links are

-this.
+By default, when retrieving @sc{ftp} directories recursively and a symbolic link
+is encountered, the symbolic link is traversed and the pointed-to files are
+retrieved.  Currently, Wget does not traverse symbolic links to directories to
+download them recursively, though this feature may be added in the future.

+filesystem.  The pointed-to file will not be retrieved unless this recursive
+retrieval would have encountered it separately and downloaded it anyway.  This
+option poses a security risk where a malicious FTP Server may cause Wget to
+write to files outside of the intended directories through a specially crafted
+@sc{.listing} file.
 
 Note that when retrieving a file (not a directory) because it was
 specified on the command-line, rather than because it was recursed to,
