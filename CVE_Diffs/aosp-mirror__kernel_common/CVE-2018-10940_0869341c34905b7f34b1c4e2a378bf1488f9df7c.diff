    cdrom: fix improper type cast, which can leat to information leak.
    
    commit e4f3aa2e1e67bb48dfbaaf1cad59013d5a5bc276 upstream.
    
    There is another cast from unsigned long to int which causes
    a bounds check to fail with specially crafted input. The value is
    then used as an index in the slot array in cdrom_slot_status().
    
    This issue is similar to CVE-2018-16658 and CVE-2018-10940.
