    Disabled renegotiation, to address the ssl/tls renegotiate MITM attack.
    
    See http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2009-3555.
    
    Secure renegotiation according to the tls extension remains to be
    implemented (the spec is still a draft at the time of this writing). Note
    that renegotiation often didn't work anyway due to a bug, so this change
    might not be much of a compatibility issue anyway.
