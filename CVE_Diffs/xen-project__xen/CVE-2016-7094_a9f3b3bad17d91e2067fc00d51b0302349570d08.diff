    x86/shadow: Avoid overflowing sh_ctxt->seg_reg[]
    
    hvm_get_seg_reg() does not perform a range check on its input segment, calls
    hvm_get_segment_register() and writes straight into sh_ctxt->seg_reg[].
    
    x86_seg_none is outside the bounds of sh_ctxt->seg_reg[], and will hit a BUG()
    in {vmx,svm}_get_segment_register().
    
    HVM guests running with shadow paging can end up performing a virtual to
    linear translation with x86_seg_none.  This is used for addresses which are
    already linear.  However, none of this is a legitimate pagetable update, so
    fail the emulation in such a case.
    
    This is XSA-187 / CVE-2016-7094.
