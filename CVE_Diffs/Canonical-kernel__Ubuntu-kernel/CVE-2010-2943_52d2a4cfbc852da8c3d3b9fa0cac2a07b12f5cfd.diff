    xfs: fix untrusted inode number lookup
    
    CVE-2010-2943
    
    Commit 7124fe0a5b619d65b739477b3b55a20bf805b06d ("xfs: validate untrusted inode
    numbers during lookup") changes the inode lookup code to do btree lookups for
    untrusted inode numbers. This change made an invalid assumption about the
    alignment of inodes and hence incorrectly calculated the first inode in the
    cluster. As a result, some inode numbers were being incorrectly considered
    invalid when they were actually valid.
    
    The issue was not picked up by the xfstests suite because it always runs fsr
    and dump (the two utilities that utilise the bulkstat interface) on cache hot
    inodes and hence the lookup code in the cold cache path was not sufficiently
    exercised to uncover this intermittent problem.
    
    Fix the issue by relaxing the btree lookup criteria and then checking if the
    record returned contains the inode number we are lookup for. If it we get an
    incorrect record, then the inode number is invalid.
