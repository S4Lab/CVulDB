    Export 'get_pipe_info()' to other users CVE-2010-4256
    
    BugLink: http://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/799805
    
    commit c66fb347946ebdd5b10908866ecc9fa05ee2cf3d upstream.
    
    And in particular, use it in 'pipe_fcntl()'.
    
    The other pipe functions do not need to use the 'careful' version, since
    they are only ever called for things that are already known to be pipes.
    
    The normal read/write/ioctl functions are called through the file
    operations structures, so if a file isn't a pipe, they'd never get
    called.  But pipe_fcntl() is special, and called directly from the
    generic fcntl code, and needs to use the same careful function that the
    splice code is using.
