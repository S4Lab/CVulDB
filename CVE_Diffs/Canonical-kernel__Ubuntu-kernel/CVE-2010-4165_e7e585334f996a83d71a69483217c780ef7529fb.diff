    tcp: Increase TCP_MAXSEG socket option minimum., CVE-2010-4165
    
    CVE-2010-4165
    
    As noted by Steve Chen, since commit
    f5fff5dc8a7a3f395b0525c02ba92c95d42b7390 ("tcp: advertise MSS
    requested by user") we can end up with a situation where
    tcp_select_initial_window() does a divide by a zero (or
    even negative) mss value.
    
    The problem is that sometimes we effectively subtract
    TCPOLEN_TSTAMP_ALIGNED and/or TCPOLEN_MD5SIG_ALIGNED from the mss.
    
    Fix this by increasing the minimum from 8 to 64.
