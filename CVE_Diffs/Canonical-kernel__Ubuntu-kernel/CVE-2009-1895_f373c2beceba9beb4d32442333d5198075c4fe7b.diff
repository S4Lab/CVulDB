    personality: fix PER_CLEAR_ON_SETID
    
    CVE-2009-1895
    
    commit f9fabcb58a6d26d6efde842d1703ac7cfa9427b6 upstream
    
    We have found that the current PER_CLEAR_ON_SETID mask on Linux doesn't
    include neither ADDR_COMPAT_LAYOUT, nor MMAP_PAGE_ZERO.
    
    The current mask is READ_IMPLIES_EXEC|ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE.
    
    We believe it is important to add MMAP_PAGE_ZERO, because by using this
    personality it is possible to have the first page mapped inside a
    process running as setuid root.  This could be used in those scenarios:
    
     - Exploiting a NULL pointer dereference issue in a setuid root binary
     - Bypassing the mmap_min_addr restrictions of the Linux kernel: by
       running a setuid binary that would drop privileges before giving us
       control back (for instance by loading a user-supplied library), we
       could get the first page mapped in a process we control.  By further
       using mremap and mprotect on this mapping, we can then completely
       bypass the mmap_min_addr restrictions.
    
    Less importantly, we believe ADDR_COMPAT_LAYOUT should also be added
    since on x86 32bits it will in practice disable most of the address
    space layout randomization (only the stack will remain randomized).
