    cifs: fix possible memory corruption in CIFSFindNext, CVE-2011-3191
    
    The name_len variable in CIFSFindNext is a signed int that gets set to
    the resume_name_len in the cifs_search_info. The resume_name_len however
    is unsigned and for some infolevels is populated directly from a 32 bit
    value sent by the server.
    
    If the server sends a very large value for this, then that value could
    look negative when converted to a signed int. That would make that
    value pass the PATH_MAX check later in CIFSFindNext. The name_len would
    then be used as a length value for a memcpy. It would then be treated
    as unsigned again, and the memcpy scribbles over a ton of memory.
    
    Fix this by making the name_len an unsigned value in CIFSFindNext.
