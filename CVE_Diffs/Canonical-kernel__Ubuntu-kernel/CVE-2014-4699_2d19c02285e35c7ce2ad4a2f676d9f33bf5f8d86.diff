    x86_64,ptrace: Enforce RIP <= TASK_SIZE_MAX (CVE-2014-4699)
    
    Don't allow ptrace to set RIP to a value that couldn't happen by
    ordinary control flow. There are CPU bugs^Wfeatures that can have
    interesting effects if RIP is non-canonical.
    
    I didn't make the corresponding x86_32 change, since x86_32 has no
    concept of canonical addresses.
    
    putreg32 doesn't need this fix: value is only 32 bits, so it can't
    be non-canonical.
    
    Fixes CVE-2014-4699.  There are arguably still bugs here, but this
    fixes the major issue.
