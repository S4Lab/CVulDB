    jbd2: clear BH_Delay & BH_Unwritten in journal_unmap_buffer
    
    journal_unmap_buffer()'s zap_buffer: code clears a lot of buffer head
    state ala discard_buffer(), but does not touch _Delay or _Unwritten as
    discard_buffer() does.
    
    This can be problematic in some areas of the ext4 code which assume
    that if they have found a buffer marked unwritten or delay, then it's
    a live one.  Perhaps those spots should check whether it is mapped
    as well, but if jbd2 is going to tear down a buffer, let's really
    tear it down completely.
    
    Without this I get some fsx failures on sub-page-block filesystems
    up until v3.2, at which point 4e96b2dbbf1d7e81f22047a50f862555a6cb87cb
    and 189e868fa8fdca702eb9db9d8afc46b5cb9144c9 make the failures go
    away, because buried within that large change is some more flag
    clearing.  I still think it's worth doing in jbd2, since
    ->invalidatepage leads here directly, and it's the right place
    to clear away these flags.
