    Make TASKSTATS require root access, CVE-2011-2494
    
    Ok, this isn't optimal, since it means that 'iotop' needs admin
    capabilities, and we may have to work on this some more.  But at the
    same time it is very much not acceptable to let anybody just read
    anybody elses IO statistics quite at this level.
    
    Use of the GENL_ADMIN_PERM suggested by Johannes Berg as an alternative
    to checking the capabilities by hand.
