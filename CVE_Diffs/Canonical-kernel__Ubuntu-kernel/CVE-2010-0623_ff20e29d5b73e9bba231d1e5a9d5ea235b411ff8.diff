    futex_lock_pi() key refcnt fix
    
    CVE-2010-0623
    
    This fixes a futex key reference count bug in futex_lock_pi(),
    where a key's reference count is incremented twice but decremented
    only once, causing the backing object to not be released.
    
    If the futex is created in a temporary file in an ext3 file system,
    this bug causes the file's inode to become an "undead" orphan,
    which causes an oops from a BUG_ON() in ext3_put_super() when the
    file system is unmounted. glibc's test suite is known to trigger this,
    see <http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14256>.
    
    The bug is a regression from 2.6.28-git3, namely Peter Zijlstra's
    38d47c1b7075bd7ec3881141bb3629da58f88dab "[PATCH] futex: rely on
    get_user_pages() for shared futexes". That commit made get_futex_key()
    also increment the reference count of the futex key, and updated its
    callers to decrement the key's reference count before returning.
    Unfortunately the normal exit path in futex_lock_pi() wasn't corrected:
    the reference count is incremented by get_futex_key() and queue_lock(),
    but the normal exit path only decrements once, via unqueue_me_pi().
    The fix is to put_futex_key() after unqueue_me_pi(), since 2.6.31
    this is easily done by 'goto out_put_key' rather than 'goto out'.
