    UBUNTU: SAUCE: AF_ECONET saddr->cookie prevent NULL pointer dereference
    
    CVE-2010-3849
    
    'saddr' comes from userspace and may be NULL (if non-NULL, it will have
    been copied to kernelspace), leading to a NULL-pointer dereference. This
    saddr->cookie dereference appears twice, once in the "hardware" case and
    once in the "UDP emulation" case. This is easily exploitable for an
    oops, but probably not anything more.
    
    This patch has yet to be submitted upstream, hence marking it as SAUCE
    for now.
