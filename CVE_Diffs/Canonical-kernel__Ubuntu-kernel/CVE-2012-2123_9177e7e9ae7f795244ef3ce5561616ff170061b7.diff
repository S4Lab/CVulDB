    fcaps: clear the same personality flags as suid when fcaps are used
    
    CVE-2012-2123
    
    BugLink: http://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/987571
    
    If a process increases permissions using fcaps all of the dangerous
    personality flags which are cleared for suid apps should also be cleared.
    Thus programs given priviledge with fcaps will continue to have address space
    randomization enabled even if the parent tried to disable it to make it
    easier to attack.
