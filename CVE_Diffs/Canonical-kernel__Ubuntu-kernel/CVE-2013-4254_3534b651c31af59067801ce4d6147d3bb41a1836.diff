    ARM: 7809/1: perf: fix event validation for software group leaders
    
    CVE-2013-4254
    
    BugLink: http://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1216442
    
    It is possible to construct an event group with a software event as a
    group leader and then subsequently add a hardware event to the group.
    This results in the event group being validated by adding all members
    of the group to a fake PMU and attempting to allocate each event on
    their respective PMU.
    
    Unfortunately, for software events wthout a corresponding arm_pmu, this
    results in a kernel crash attempting to dereference the ->get_event_idx
    function pointer.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by checking explicitly for software events
    and ignoring those in event validation (since they can always be
    scheduled). We will probably want to revisit this for 3.12, since the
    validation checks don't appear to work correctly when dealing with
    multiple hardware PMUs anyway.
