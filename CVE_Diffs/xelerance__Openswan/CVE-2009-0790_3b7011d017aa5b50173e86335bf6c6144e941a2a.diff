    Fix for a deadly 1 packet crasher in the DPD processing code. This bug
    is severe and has been assigned CVE-2009-0790. All versions of Openswan,
    Superfreeswan and Strongswan to date suffered from this bug. If the
    icookie/rcookie did not match for a DPD R_U_THERE or R_U_THERE_ACK, the
    pluto daemon would crash (and restart). This can be abused in a denial of
    service attack.
