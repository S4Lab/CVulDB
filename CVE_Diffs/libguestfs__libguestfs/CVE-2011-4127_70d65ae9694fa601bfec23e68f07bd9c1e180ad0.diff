    Security: Mitigate possible privilege escalation via SG_IO ioctl (CVE-2011-4127, RHBZ#757071)
    
    CVE-2011-4127 is a serious qemu & kernel privilege escalation bug
    found by Paolo Bonzini.
    
    http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q4/536
    
    An untrusted guest kernel is able to issue special SG_IO ioctls on
    virtio devices which qemu passes through to the host kernel without
    filtering or sanitizing.  These ioctls allow raw sectors from the
    underlying host device to be read and written.  Significantly, neither
    qemu nor the host kernel checks that the range of sectors is within
    the partition / LV assigned to the guest.  For example, if the guest
    is assigned host partition /dev/sda3, it would be able to read or
    write any part of /dev/sda including other partitions and the boot
    sector.  Exploits through LVs passed to the guest are also possible,
    with some limitations.  File-backed virtual block devices are not
    vulnerable.  Non-virtio block devices are not vulnerable.
    
    This patch mitigates the problem by disabling the SG_IO ioctl
    passthrough in qemu.  Thus if libguestfs is examining an untrusted
    guest and the libguestfs appliance/daemon is compromised (eg. by
    executing guest commands, or through some other compromise), then the
    compromised appliance will not be able to issue the above SG_IO ioctls
    and exploit the host.
    
    Note that this is just mitigation for libguestfs.  Users will still
    want to fully update their host kernel, qemu/KVM and libvirt, in order
    to prevent other (non-libguestfs) routes to compromise.
    
    The following versions of libguestfs (will/have) this patch applied.
    
      libguestfs >= 1.15.13
      libguestfs >= 1.14.8
      libguestfs >= 1.12.11
      libguestfs >= 1.10.12
      libguestfs >= 1.8.16
    
    Earlier versions may be vulnerable unless a downstream packager has
    applied this patch.
