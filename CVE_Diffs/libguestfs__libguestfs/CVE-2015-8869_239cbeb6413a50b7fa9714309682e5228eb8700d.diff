+
+This vulnerability in OCaml might affect virt tools written in the
+OCaml programming language.  It affects only 64 bit platforms.
+Because this bug affects code generation it is difficult to predict
+which precise software could be affected, and therefore our
+recommendation is that you recompile libguestfs using a version of the
+OCaml compiler where this bug has been fixed (or ask your Linux distro
+to do the same).
