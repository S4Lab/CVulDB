+
+Old versions of both virt-edit and the guestfish C<edit> command
+created a new file containing the changes but did not set the
+permissions, etc of the new file to match the old one.  The result of
+this was that if you edited a security sensitive file such as
+C</etc/shadow> then it would be left world-readable after the edit.
+
+This issue was assigned CVE-2012-2690, and is fixed in
+libguestfs E<ge> 1.16.
