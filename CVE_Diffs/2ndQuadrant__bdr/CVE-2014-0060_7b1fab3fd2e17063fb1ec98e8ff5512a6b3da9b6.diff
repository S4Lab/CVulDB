+      The primary role of PL validator functions is to be called implicitly

+      a function actually written in some other language was not checked
+      for and could be exploited for privilege-escalation purposes.
+      The fix involves adding a call to a privilege-checking function in
+      each validator function.  Non-core procedural languages will also
+      need to make this change to their own validator functions, if any.

+
+     <para>
+      Granting a role without <literal>ADMIN OPTION</> is supposed to
+      prevent the grantee from adding or removing members from the granted
+      role, but this restriction was easily bypassed by doing <literal>SET
+      ROLE</> first.  The security impact is mostly that a role member can

+      Unapproved role member additions are a lesser concern, since an
+      uncooperative role member could provide most of his rights to others
+      anyway by creating views or <literal>SECURITY DEFINER</> functions.

+
+     <para>
+      The primary role of PL validator functions is to be called implicitly
+      during <command>CREATE FUNCTION</>, but they are also normal SQL
+      functions that a user can call explicitly.  Calling a validator on
+      a function actually written in some other language was not checked
+      for and could be exploited for privilege-escalation purposes.
+      The fix involves adding a call to a privilege-checking function in
+      each validator function.  Non-core procedural languages will also
+      need to make this change to their own validator functions, if any.
