  Changes between 1.1.1 and 3.0.0 [xx XXX xxxx]
 
+  *) Fixed an an overflow bug in the x64_64 Montgomery squaring procedure
+     used in exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are
+     affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024,
+     3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very
+     difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512
+     are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would
+     have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway.
+     Also applications directly using the low level API BN_mod_exp may be
+     affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME.

   *) Introduced a new method type and API, OSSL_SERIALIZER, to
      represent generic serializers.  An implementation is expected to
      be able to serialize an object associated with a given name (such
