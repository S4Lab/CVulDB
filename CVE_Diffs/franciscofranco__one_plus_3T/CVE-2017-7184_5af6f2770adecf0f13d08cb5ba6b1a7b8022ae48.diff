    xfrm_user: validate XFRM_MSG_NEWAE XFRMA_REPLAY_ESN_VAL replay_window
    
    When a new xfrm state is created during an XFRM_MSG_NEWSA call we validate
    the user supplied replay_esn to ensure that the size is valid and to ensure
    that the replay_window size is within the allocated buffer.  However later
    it is possible to update this replay_esn via a XFRM_MSG_NEWAE call.
    There we again validate the size of the supplied buffer matches the
    existing state and if so inject the contents.  We do not at this point
    check that the replay_window is within the allocated memory.  This leads
    to out-of-bounds reads and writes triggered by netlink packets.  This leads
    to memory corruption and the potential for priviledge escalation.
    
    We already attempt to validate the incoming replay information in
    xfrm_new_ae() via xfrm_replay_verify_len().  This confirms that the
    user is not trying to change the size of the replay state buffer which
    includes the replay_esn.  It however does not check the replay_window
    remains within that buffer.  Add validation of the contained replay_window.
    
    Additionally Kees Cook has pointed out that xfrm_replay_state_esn_len()
    is subject to wrapping issues.  To ensure we are correctly ensuring that
    the two ESN structures are the same size compare both the overall size
    as reported by xfrm_replay_state_esn_len() and the internal length are
    the same.
