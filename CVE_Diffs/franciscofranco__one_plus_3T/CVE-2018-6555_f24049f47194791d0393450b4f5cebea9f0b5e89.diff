    irda: Only insert new objects into the global database via setsockopt
    
    The irda_setsockopt() function conditionally allocates memory for a new
    self->ias_object or, in some cases, reuses the existing
    self->ias_object. Existing objects were incorrectly reinserted into the
    LM_IAS database which corrupted the doubly linked list used for the
    hashbin implementation of the LM_IAS database. When combined with a
    memory leak in irda_bind(), this issue could be leveraged to create a
    use-after-free vulnerability in the hashbin list. This patch fixes the
    issue by only inserting newly allocated objects into the database.
