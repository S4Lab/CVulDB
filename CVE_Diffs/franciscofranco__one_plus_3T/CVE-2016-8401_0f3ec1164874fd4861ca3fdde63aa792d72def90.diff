    usb: Avoid exposing kernel addresses
    
    Usage of %p exposes the kernel addresses, an easy target to
    kernel write vulnerabilities. With this patch currently
    %pK prints only Zeros as address. If you need actual address
    echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict
    addressing the info leak  issue under following CVEs
    CVE-2016-8401, CVE-2016-8403, CVE-2016-8404, CVE-2016-8407
