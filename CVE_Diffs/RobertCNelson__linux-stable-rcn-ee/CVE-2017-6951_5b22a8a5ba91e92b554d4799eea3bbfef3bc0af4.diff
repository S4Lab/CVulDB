    KEYS: Change the name of the dead type to ".dead" to prevent user access
    
    commit c1644fe041ebaf6519f6809146a77c3ead9193af upstream.
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-6951.
    
    Userspace should not be able to do things with the "dead" key type as it
    doesn't have some of the helper functions set upon it that the kernel
    needs.  Attempting to use it may cause the kernel to crash.
    
    Fix this by changing the name of the type to ".dead" so that it's rejected
    up front on userspace syscalls by key_get_type_from_user().
    
    Though this doesn't seem to affect recent kernels, it does affect older
    ones, certainly those prior to:

            KEYS: Remove key_type::match in favour of overriding default by match_preparse
    
    which went in before 3.18-rc1.
