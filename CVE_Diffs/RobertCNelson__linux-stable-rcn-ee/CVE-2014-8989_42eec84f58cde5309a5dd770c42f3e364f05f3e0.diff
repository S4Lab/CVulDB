    userns: Only allow the creator of the userns unprivileged mappings
    
    commit f95d7918bd1e724675de4940039f2865e5eec5fe upstream.
    
    If you did not create the user namespace and are allowed
    to write to uid_map or gid_map you should already have the necessary
    privilege in the parent user namespace to establish any mapping
    you want so this will not affect userspace in practice.
    
    Limiting unprivileged uid mapping establishment to the creator of the
    user namespace makes it easier to verify all credentials obtained with
    the uid mapping can be obtained without the uid mapping without
    privilege.
    
    Limiting unprivileged gid mapping establishment (which is temporarily
    absent) to the creator of the user namespace also ensures that the
    combination of uid and gid can already be obtained without privilege.
    
    This is part of the fix for CVE-2014-8989.
