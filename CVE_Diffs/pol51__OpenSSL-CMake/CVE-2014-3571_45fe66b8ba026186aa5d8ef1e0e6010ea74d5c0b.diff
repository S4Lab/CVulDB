    Follow on from CVE-2014-3571. This fixes the code that was the original source
    of the crash due to p being NULL. Steve's fix prevents this situation from
    occuring - however this is by no means obvious by looking at the code for
    dtls1_get_record. This fix just makes things look a bit more sane.
