    dix: GetHosts bounds check using wrong pointer value [CVE-2014-8092 pt. 6]
    
    GetHosts saves the pointer to allocated memory in *data, and then
    wants to bounds-check writes to that region, but was mistakenly using
    a bare 'data' instead of '*data'. Also, data is declared as void **,
    so we need a cast to turn it into a byte pointer so we can actually do
    pointer comparisons.
