    dbe: Call to DDX SwapBuffers requires address of int, not unsigned int [CVE-2014-8097 pt. 2]
    
    When the local types used to walk the DBE request were changed, this
    changed the type of the parameter passed to the DDX SwapBuffers API,
    but there wasn't a matching change in the API definition.
    
    At this point, with the API frozen, I just stuck a new variable in
    with the correct type. Because we've already bounds-checked nStuff to
    be smaller than UINT32_MAX / sizeof(DbeSwapInfoRec), we know it will
    fit in a signed int without overflow.
