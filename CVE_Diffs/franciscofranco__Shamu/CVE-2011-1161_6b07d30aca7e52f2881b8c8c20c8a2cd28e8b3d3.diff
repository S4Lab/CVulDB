    TPM: Call tpm_transmit with correct size
    
    This patch changes the call of tpm_transmit by supplying the size of the
    userspace buffer instead of TPM_BUFSIZE.
    
    This got assigned CVE-2011-1161.
    
    [The first hunk didn't make sense given one could expect
     way less data than TPM_BUFSIZE, so added tpm_transmit boundary
     check over bufsiz instead
     The last parameter of tpm_transmit() reflects the amount
     of data expected from the device, and not the buffer size
     being supplied to it. It isn't ideal to parse it directly,
     so we just set it to the maximum the input buffer can handle
     and let the userspace API to do such job.]
