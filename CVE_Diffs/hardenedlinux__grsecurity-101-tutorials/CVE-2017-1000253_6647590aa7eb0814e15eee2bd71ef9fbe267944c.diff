 May we screw again!
 
+Update( Sep 28): Red Hat didn't backport the one of [fixes for stack clash](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86) and yet we don't know why RH didn't treat the fix as a security issue. According to the [Qualys security advisory](https://www.qualys.com/2017/09/26/cve-2017-1000253/cve-2017-1000253.txt), this issue( CVE-2017-1000253) affected RHEL/CentOS 6/7.
 
 Update( Jun 25 2017): CVE-2017-1000370( offset2lib bypass) is still not fixed. RedHat says this issue is still in "[Under Investigation](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDGLuOUUAAEtWOe.jpg:large)" just could be implying that they are waiting for [the patch](http://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2017/06/23/21) from the upstream "community". The whole [fixes for the stack clash](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/06/24/9) are originally from PaX/Grsecurity's fix in 2010. The funny thing is Linus Torvalds called PaX/Grsecurity ["Their patches are pure garbage."](https://www.spinics.net/lists/kernel/msg2540934.html) a few days ago. A couple of [silent fixes being fully disclosure](http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q2/583) and then Linus seems ["inviting" PaX team/Spender send him the patch](http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q2/584). Linus shouldn't call PaX/Grsecurity is the garbage because there's a group of ppl called themselves KSPP got paid by big corps and Linux foundation are still trying to copy+paste PaX/Grsecurity to the upstream, and more importantly, [Linus himself merged a lot patches](https://github.com/hardenedlinux/grsecurity-101-tutorials/blob/master/kernel_mitigation.md). LF/CII may never care about [exploitable bugs](https://github.com/hardenedlinux/grsecurity-101-tutorials/blob/master/kernel_vuln_exp.md) which could be turned into massive exploitation by malware or weaponized exploit target on the high value asset. They only cares about money. We suggest those who concerns the real sense of security should go re-assessment the security risk of linux kernel which running on your *IMPORTANT* machines.
