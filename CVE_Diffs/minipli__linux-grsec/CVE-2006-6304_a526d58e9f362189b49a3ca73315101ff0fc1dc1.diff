    Heh, the very first line:
    fs/exec.c(1465): remark #593: variable "flag" was set but never used
    
    fs/exec.c:
      1477          /*
      1478           *      We cannot trust fsuid as being the "true" uid of the
      1479           *      process nor do we know its entire history. We only know it
      1480           *      was tainted so we dump it as root in mode 2.
      1481           */
      1482          if (mm->dumpable == 2) {        /* Setuid core dump mode */
      1483                  flag = O_EXCL;          /* Stop rewrite attacks */
      1484                  current->fsuid = 0;     /* Dump root private */
      1485          }
    
    And then filp_open follows with "flag" totally ignored.
