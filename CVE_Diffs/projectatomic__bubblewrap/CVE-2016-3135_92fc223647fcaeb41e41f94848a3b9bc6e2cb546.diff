+User namespaces
+---------------
+
 There is an effort in the Linux kernel called
 [user namespaces](https://www.google.com/search?q=user+namespaces+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Flwn.net)
 which attempts to allow unprivileged users to use container features.
 While significant progress has been made, there are
 [still concerns](https://lwn.net/Articles/673597/) about it.

+Bubblewrap could be viewed as setuid implementation of a *subset* of
+user namespaces.  Emphasis on subset - specifically relevant to the
+above CVE, bubblewrap does not allow control over iptables.
 
-It inherits code from
+The original bubblewrap code existed before user namespaces - it inherits code from
 [xdg-app helper](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/xdg-app/xdg-app/tree/common/xdg-app-helper.c)
 which in turn distantly derives from
 [linux-user-chroot](https://git.gnome.org/browse/linux-user-chroot).
