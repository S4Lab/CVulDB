    Fix priv checks for ALTER <object> DEPENDS ON EXTENSION
    
    Marking an object as dependant on an extension did not have any
    privilege check whatsoever; this allowed any user to mark objects as
    droppable by anyone able to DROP EXTENSION, which could be used to cause
    system-wide havoc.  Disallow by checking that the calling user owns the
    mentioned object.
    
    (No constraints are placed on the extension.)
