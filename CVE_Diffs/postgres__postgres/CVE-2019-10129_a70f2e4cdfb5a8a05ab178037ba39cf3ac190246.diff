+     <para>
+      Some of the planner's selectivity estimators apply user-defined
+      operators to values found in <structname>pg_statistic</structname>
+      (e.g., most-common values).  A leaky operator therefore can disclose
+      some of the entries in a data column, even if the calling user lacks
+      permission to read that column.  In CVE-2017-7484 we added
+      restrictions to forestall that, but we failed to consider the
+      effects of row-level security.  A user who has SQL permission to
+      read a column, but who is forbidden to see certain rows due to RLS
+      policy, might still learn something about those rows' contents via a
+      leaky operator.  This patch further tightens the rules, allowing
+      leaky operators to be applied to statistics data only when there is
+      no relevant RLS policy.  (CVE-2019-10130)
