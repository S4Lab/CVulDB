+     </para>
+
+     <para>
+      <productname>PostgreSQL</> includes a replacement implementation
+      of <function>printf</> and related functions.  This code will overrun
+      a stack buffer when formatting a floating point number (conversion
+      specifiers <literal>e</>, <literal>E</>, <literal>f</>, <literal>F</>,
+      <literal>g</> or <literal>G</>) with requested precision greater than
+      about 500.  This will crash the server, and we have not ruled out the
+      possibility of attacks that lead to privilege escalation.
+      A database user can trigger such a buffer overrun through
+      the <function>to_char()</> SQL function.  While that is the only
+      affected core <productname>PostgreSQL</> functionality, extension
+      modules that use printf-family functions may be at risk as well.
+     </para>
+
+     <para>
+      This issue primarily affects <productname>PostgreSQL</> on Windows.
+      <productname>PostgreSQL</> uses the system implementation of these
+      functions where adequate, which it is on other modern platforms.

+      Fix possible loss of frontend/backend protocol synchronization after

+      (Heikki Linnakangas)
+     </para>
+
+     <para>
+      If any error occurred while the server was in the middle of reading a
+      protocol message from the client, it could lose synchronization and
+      incorrectly try to interpret part of the message's data as a new
+      protocol message.  An attacker able to submit crafted binary data
+      within a command parameter might succeed in injecting his own SQL
+      commands this way.  Statement timeout and query cancellation are the
+      most likely sources of errors triggering this scenario.  Particularly
+      vulnerable are applications that use a timeout and also submit
+      arbitrary user-crafted data as binary query parameters.  Disabling
+      statement timeout will reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of
+      exploit.  Our thanks to Emil Lenngren for reporting this issue.
