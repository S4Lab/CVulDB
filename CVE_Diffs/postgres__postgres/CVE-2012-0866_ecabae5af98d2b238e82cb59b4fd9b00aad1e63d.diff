+     <para>
+      This missing check could allow another user to execute a trigger
+      function with forged input data, by installing it on a table he owns.
+      This is only of significance for trigger functions marked
+      <literal>SECURITY DEFINER</>, since otherwise trigger functions run
+      as the table owner anyway.  (CVE-2012-0866)

+     <para>
+      <application>pg_dump</> was incautious about sanitizing object names
+      that are emitted within SQL comments in its output script.  A name
+      containing a newline would at least render the script syntactically
+      incorrect.  Maliciously crafted object names could present a SQL
+      injection risk when the script is reloaded.  (CVE-2012-0868)
