    Sort out paired double quotes in \connect, \password and \crosstabview.
    
    In arguments, these meta-commands wrongly treated each pair as closing
    the double quoted string.  Make the behavior match the documentation.
    This is a compatibility break, but I more expect to find software with
    untested reliance on the documented behavior than software reliant on
    today's behavior.  Back-patch to 9.1 (all supported versions).
