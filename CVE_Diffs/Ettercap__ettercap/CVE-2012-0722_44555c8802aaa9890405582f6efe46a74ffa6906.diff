    Remove dead code from CVE-2012-0722 patch provided by Sajjad
    
    That patch contains these lines:
    
     #define        NS_IN6ADDRSZ 16
     #define        NS_INT16SZ = 2
    
    As noted by Adam D. Barratt <adam@adam-barratt.org.uk>, the "=" in the
    second is bogus.  This bug did not break the build because these
    definitions were shadowed anyway.
