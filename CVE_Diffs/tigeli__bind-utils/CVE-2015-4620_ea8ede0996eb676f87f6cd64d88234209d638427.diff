-	  A flaw in delegation handling could be exploited to put
-	  <command>named</command> into an infinite loop, in which
-	  each lookup of a name server triggered additional lookups
-	  of more name servers.  This has been addressed by placing
-	  limits on the number of levels of recursion
-	  <command>named</command> will allow (default 7), and
-	  on the number of queries that it will send before
-	  terminating a recursive query (default 50).
