 * The line-ending filtering logic - when checking out files - has been
   updated to match newer git (>= git 2.9) for proper interoperability.
 
+* Submodules with names which attempt to perform path traversal now have their
+  configuration ignored. Such names were blindly appended to the
+  `$GIT_DIR/modules` and a malicious name could lead to an attacker writing to
+  an arbitrary location. This matches git's handling of CVE-2018-11235.
