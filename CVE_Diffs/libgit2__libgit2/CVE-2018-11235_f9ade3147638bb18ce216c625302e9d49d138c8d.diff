 While submodule names come from the untrusted ".gitmodules" file, we blindly
 append the name to "$GIT_DIR/modules" to construct the final path of the
 submodule repository. In case the name contains e.g. "../", an adversary would

 accordance with git, we now enforce some rules for submodule names which will

+Adding a symlink as `.gitmodules` into the index from the workdir or checking

 libgit2 is not susceptible to CVE-2018-11233.
