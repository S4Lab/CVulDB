    ipsec: Fix aborted xfrm policy dump crash
    
    commit 1137b5e2529a8f5ca8ee709288ecba3e68044df2 upstream.
    
    This is a fix for CVE-2017-16939 suitable for older stable branches.
    The upstream fix is commit 1137b5e2529a8f5ca8ee709288ecba3e68044df2,
    from which the following explanation is taken:
    
        An independent security researcher, Mohamed Ghannam, has reported
        this vulnerability to Beyond Security's SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure
        program.
    
        The xfrm_dump_policy_done function expects xfrm_dump_policy to
        have been called at least once or it will crash.  This can be
        triggered if a dump fails because the target socket's receive
        buffer is full.
    
    It was not possible to define a 'start' callback for netlink dumps
    until Linux 4.5, so instead add a check for the initialisation flag in
    the 'done' callback.
