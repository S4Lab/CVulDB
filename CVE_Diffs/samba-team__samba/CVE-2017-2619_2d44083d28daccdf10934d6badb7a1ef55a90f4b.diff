-=====================
+                   =============================
+                   Release Notes for Samba 4.6.1
+                           March 23, 2017
+                   =============================
+
+
+This is a security release in order to address the following defect:
+
+o  CVE-2017-2619 (Symlink race allows access outside share definition)
+
+=======
+Details
+=======
+
+o  CVE-2017-2619:
+   All versions of Samba prior to 4.6.1, 4.5.7, 4.4.11 are vulnerable to
+   a malicious client using a symlink race to allow access to areas of
+   the server file system not exported under the share definition.
+
+   Samba uses the realpath() system call to ensure when a client requests
+   access to a pathname that it is under the exported share path on the
+   server file system.
+
+   Clients that have write access to the exported part of the file system
+   via SMB1 unix extensions or NFS to create symlinks can race the server
+   by renaming a realpath() checked path and then creating a symlink. If
+   the client wins the race it can cause the server to access the new
+   symlink target after the exported share path check has been done. This
+   new symlink target can point to anywhere on the server file system.
+
+   This is a difficult race to win, but theoretically possible. Note that
+   the proof of concept code supplied wins the race reliably only when
+   the server is slowed down using the strace utility running on the
+   server. Exploitation of this bug has not been seen in the wild.
+
