+                   Release Notes for Samba 4.3.11
+                            July 07, 2016
+                   ==============================
+
+
+This is a security release in order to address the following defect:
+
+o  CVE-2016-2119 (Client side SMB2/3 required signing can be downgraded)
+
+=======
+Details
+=======
+
+o  CVE-2016-2119:
+   It's possible for an attacker to downgrade the required signing for
+   an SMB2/3 client connection, by injecting the SMB2_SESSION_FLAG_IS_GUEST
+   or SMB2_SESSION_FLAG_IS_NULL flags.
+
+   This means that the attacker can impersonate a server being connected to by
+   Samba, and return malicious results.
+
+   The primary concern is with winbindd, as it uses DCERPC over SMB2 when talking
+   to domain controllers as a member server, and trusted domains as a domain
+   controller.  These DCE/RPC connections were intended to protected by the
+   combination of "client ipc signing" and
+   "client ipc max protocol" in their effective default settings
+   ("mandatory" and "SMB3_11").
+
+   Additionally, management tools like net, samba-tool and rpcclient use DCERPC
+   over SMB2/3 connections.
+
+   By default, other tools in Samba are unprotected, but rarely they are
+   configured to use smb signing, via the "client signing" parameter (the default
+   is "if_required").  Even more rarely the "client max protocol" is set to SMB2,
+   rather than the NT1 default.
+
+   If both these conditions are met, then this issue would also apply to these
+   other tools, including command line tools like smbcacls, smbcquota, smbclient,
+   smbget and applications using libsmbclient.
+
