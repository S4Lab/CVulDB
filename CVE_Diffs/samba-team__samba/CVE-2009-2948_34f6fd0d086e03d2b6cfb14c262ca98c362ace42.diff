    mount.cifs: check access of credential files before opening
    
    It's possible for an unprivileged user to pass a setuid mount.cifs a
    credential or password file to which he does not have access. This can cause
    mount.cifs to open the file on his behalf and possibly leak the info in the
    first few lines of the file.
    
    Check the access permissions of the file before opening it.
