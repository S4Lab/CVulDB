+                   =============================
+                   Release Notes for Samba 4.0.1
+                          January 15, 2013
+                   =============================
+
+
+This is a security release in order to address CVE-2013-0172.
+
+o  CVE-2013-0172:
+   Samba 4.0.0 as an AD DC may provide authenticated users with write access
+   to LDAP directory objects.
+
+   In AD, Access Control Entries can be assigned based on the objectClass
+   of the object.  If a user or a group the user is a member of has any
+   access based on the objectClass, then that user has write access to that
+   object.
+
+   Additionally, if a user has write access to any attribute on the object,
+   they may have access to write to all attributes.
+
+   An important mitigation is that anonymous access is totally disabled by
+   default.  The second important mitigation is that normal users are
+   typically only given the problematic per-objectClass right via the
+   "pre-windows 2000 compatible access" group, and Samba 4.0.0 incorrectly
+   does not make "authenticated users" part of this group.
+
+Changes since 4.0.0:
+====================
+
+o   Andrew Bartlett <abartlet@samba.org>
+    * Bug 9554 - CVE-2013-0172 - Samba 4.0 as an AD DC may provide authenticated
+      users with write access to LDAP directory objects.
