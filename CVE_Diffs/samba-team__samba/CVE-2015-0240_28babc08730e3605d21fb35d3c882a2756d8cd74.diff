+                   Release Notes for Samba 4.0.25
+                          February 23, 2015
+                   ==============================
+
+
+This is a security release in order to address CVE-2015-0240 (Unexpected
+code execution in smbd).
+
+o  CVE-2015-0240:
+   All versions of Samba from 3.5.0 to 4.2.0rc4 are vulnerable to an
+   unexpected code execution vulnerability in the smbd file server
+   daemon.
+
+   A malicious client could send packets that may set up the stack in
+   such a way that the freeing of memory in a subsequent anonymous
+   netlogon packet could allow execution of arbitrary code. This code
+   would execute with root privileges.
+
+
+Changes since 4.0.24:
+---------------------
+
+o   Jeremy Allison <jra@samba.org>
