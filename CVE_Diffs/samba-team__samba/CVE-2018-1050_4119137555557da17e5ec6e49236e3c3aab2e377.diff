+                   Release Notes for Samba 4.7.6
+                           March 13, 2018
+                   =============================
+
+
+This is a security release in order to address the following defects:
+
+o  CVE-2018-1050 (Denial of Service Attack on external print server.) 
+o  CVE-2018-1057 (Authenticated users can change other users' password.)
+
+
+=======
+Details
+=======
+
+o  CVE-2018-1050:
+   All versions of Samba from 4.0.0 onwards are vulnerable to a denial of
+   service attack when the RPC spoolss service is configured to be run as
+   an external daemon. Missing input sanitization checks on some of the
+   input parameters to spoolss RPC calls could cause the print spooler
+   service to crash.
+
+   There is no known vulnerability associated with this error, merely a
+   denial of service. If the RPC spoolss service is left by default as an
+   internal service, all a client can do is crash its own authenticated
+   connection.
+
+o  CVE-2018-1057:
+   On a Samba 4 AD DC the LDAP server in all versions of Samba from
+   4.0.0 onwards incorrectly validates permissions to modify passwords
+   over LDAP allowing authenticated users to change any other users'
+   passwords, including administrative users.
+
+   Possible workarounds are described at a dedicated page in the Samba wiki:
+   https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/CVE-2018-1057
