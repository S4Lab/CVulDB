    ecryptfs: don't allow mmap when the lower fs doesn't support it
    
    [ Upstream commit f0fe970df3838c202ef6c07a4c2b36838ef0a88b ]
    
    There are legitimate reasons to disallow mmap on certain files, notably
    in sysfs or procfs.  We shouldn't emulate mmap support on file systems
    that don't offer support natively.
