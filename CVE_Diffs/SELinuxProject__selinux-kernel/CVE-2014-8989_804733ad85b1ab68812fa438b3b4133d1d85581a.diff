    userns: Don't allow unprivileged creation of gid mappings
    
    commit be7c6dba2332cef0677fbabb606e279ae76652c3 upstream.
    
    As any gid mapping will allow and must allow for backwards
    compatibility dropping groups don't allow any gid mappings to be
    established without CAP_SETGID in the parent user namespace.
    
    For a small class of applications this change breaks userspace
    and removes useful functionality.  This small class of applications
    includes tools/testing/selftests/mount/unprivilged-remount-test.c
    
    Most of the removed functionality will be added back with the addition
    of a one way knob to disable setgroups.  Once setgroups is disabled
    setting the gid_map becomes as safe as setting the uid_map.
    
    For more common applications that set the uid_map and the gid_map
    with privilege this change will have no affect.
    
    This is part of a fix for CVE-2014-8989.
