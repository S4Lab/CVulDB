    [PATCH] Keys: Fix oops when adding key to non-keyring [CVE-2006-1522]
    
    This fixes the problem of an oops occuring when a user attempts to add a
    key to a non-keyring key [CVE-2006-1522].
    
    The problem is that __keyring_search_one() doesn't check that the
    keyring it's been given is actually a keyring.
    
    I've fixed this problem by:
    
     (1) declaring that caller of __keyring_search_one() must guarantee that
         the keyring is a keyring; and
    
     (2) making key_create_or_update() check that the keyring is a keyring,
         and return -ENOTDIR if it isn't.
    
    This can be tested by:
    
            keyctl add user b b `keyctl add user a a @s`
