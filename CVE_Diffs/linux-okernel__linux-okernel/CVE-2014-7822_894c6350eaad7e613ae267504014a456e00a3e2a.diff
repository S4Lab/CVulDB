    splice: Apply generic position and size checks to each write
    
    We need to check the position and size of file writes against various
    limits, using generic_write_check().  This was not being done for
    the splice write path.  It was fixed upstream by commit 8d0207652cbe
    ("->splice_write() via ->write_iter()") but we can't apply that.
