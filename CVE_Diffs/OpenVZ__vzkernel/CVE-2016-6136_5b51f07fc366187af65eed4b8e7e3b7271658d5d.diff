    ms/audit: fix a double fetch in audit_log_single_execve_arg()
    
    There is a double fetch problem in audit_log_single_execve_arg()
    where we first check the execve(2) argumnets for any "bad" characters
    which would require hex encoding and then re-fetch the arguments for
    logging in the audit record[1].  Of course this leaves a window of
    opportunity for an unsavory application to munge with the data.
    
    This patch reworks things by only fetching the argument data once[2]
    into a buffer where it is scanned and logged into the audit
    records(s).  In addition to fixing the double fetch, this patch
    improves on the original code in a few other ways: better handling
    of large arguments which require encoding, stricter record length
    checking, and some performance improvements (completely unverified,
    but we got rid of some strlen() calls, that's got to be a good
    thing).
    
    As part of the development of this patch, I've also created a basic
    regression test for the audit-testsuite, the test can be tracked on
    GitHub at the following link:
    
     * https://github.com/linux-audit/audit-testsuite/issues/25
    
    [1] If you pay careful attention, there is actually a triple fetch
    problem due to a strnlen_user() call at the top of the function.
    
    [2] This is a tiny white lie, we do make a call to strnlen_user()
    prior to fetching the argument data.  I don't like it, but due to the
    way the audit record is structured we really have no choice unless we
    copy the entire argument at once (which would require a rather
    wasteful allocation).  The good news is that with this patch the
    kernel no longer relies on this strnlen_user() value for anything
    beyond recording it in the log, we also update it with a trustworthy
    value whenever possible.
