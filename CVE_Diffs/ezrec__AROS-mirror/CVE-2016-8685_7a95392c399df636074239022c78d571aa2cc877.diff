    Potrace updated to v1.14
    
    From the ChangeLog:
    v1.14 2017/02/19
            (2017/02/19) PS1 - speed: use clang as default compiler if
            available, and no longer use -ffloat-store even with gcc.
            (2017/02/18) PS1 - corrected some exit codes, added some missing
            error handlers.
            (2017/02/17) PS1 - mkbitmap: bugfixes and improvements in parsing
            image files.
            (2017/02/15) PS1 - truncate the image size when bitmap data ends
            prematurely. This fixes CVE-2016-8686, where Potrace appeared to
            be "hanging" on a crafted input file.
            (2017/02/14) PS1 - test suite: added tests for plain pnm files.
            (2017/01/08) PS1 - fixed potential compiler issues due to signed
            arithmetic overflow and arithmetic shifting.
            (2017/01/07) PS1 - enable use of negative dy in bitmap data.
            (2017/01/07) PS1 - test suite: moved data files to a subdirectory.
            (2017/01/07) PS1 - test suite: added a check for -i flag.
            (2017/01/07) PS1 - fixed buffer overflow CVE-2016-8685, reported
            by Agostino Sarubbo.
            (2015/10/24) PS1 - portability: use const char * for string
            constants, required by C++11. Reported by Martin Gieseking.
            (2015/10/24) PS1 - portability: extra spaces around string macros,
            required by C++11. Reported by Martin Gieseking.
            (2015/10/24) PS1 - portability: added more potential C compilers
            to autoconf. Suggested by Nelson Beebe.
