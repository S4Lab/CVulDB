    open|creat: skip S_ISGID check on files created by non-group members
    
    0fa3ecd87848 ("Fix up non-directory creation in SGID directories")
    fixes problem described in CVE-2018-13405. This commit is getting
    backported to older streams as well.
    
    This patch removes S_ISGID check for files created by non-group members
    in LTP tests creat08 and open10.
    
    Once 0fa3ecd87848 will be in non-rc kernel, we could add a new test
    for this CVE that would be limited to 4.18+ kernels.
