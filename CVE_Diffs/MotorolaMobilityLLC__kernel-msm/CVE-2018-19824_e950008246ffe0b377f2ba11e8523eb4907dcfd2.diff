    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix UAF decrement if card has no live interfaces in card.c
    
    If a USB sound card reports 0 interfaces, an error condition is triggered
    and the function usb_audio_probe errors out. In the error path, there was a
    use-after-free vulnerability where the memory object of the card was first
    freed, followed by a decrement of the number of active chips. Moving the
    decrement above the atomic_dec fixes the UAF.
    
    [ The oriGinal problem was introduced in 3.1 kernel, while it was
      developed in a different form.  The Fixes tag below indicates the
      oriGinal commit but it doesn't mean that the patch is applicable
      cleanly. -- tiwai ]
