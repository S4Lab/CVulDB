    perf: don't leave group_entry on sibling list (use-after-free)
    
    When perf_group_detach is called on a group leader,
    it should empty its sibling list. Otherwise, when
    a sibling is later deallocated, list_del_event()
    removes the sibling's group_entry from its current
    list, which can be the now-deallocated group leader's
    sibling list (use-after-free bug).
