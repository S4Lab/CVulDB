    sctp: do not peel off an assoc from one netns to another one
    
    Now when peeling off an association to the sock in another netns, all
    transports in this assoc are not to be rehashed and keep use the old
    key in hashtable.
    
    As a transport uses sk->net as the hash key to insert into hashtable,
    it would miss removing these transports from hashtable due to the new
    netns when closing the sock and all transports are being freeed, then
    later an use-after-free issue could be caused when looking up an asoc
    and dereferencing those transports.
    
    This is a very old issue since very beginning, ChunYu found it with
    syzkaller fuzz testing with this series:
    
      socket$inet6_sctp()
      bind$inet6()
      sendto$inet6()
      unshare(0x40000000)
      getsockopt$inet_sctp6_SCTP_GET_ASSOC_ID_LIST()
      getsockopt$inet_sctp6_SCTP_SOCKOPT_PEELOFF()
    
    This patch is to block this call when peeling one assoc off from one
    netns to another one, so that the netns of all transport would not
    go out-sync with the key in hashtable.
    
    Note that this patch didn't fix it by rehashing transports, as it's
    difficult to handle the situation when the tuple is already in use
    in the new netns. Besides, no one would like to peel off one assoc
    to another netns, considering ipaddrs, ifaces, etc. are usually
    different.
