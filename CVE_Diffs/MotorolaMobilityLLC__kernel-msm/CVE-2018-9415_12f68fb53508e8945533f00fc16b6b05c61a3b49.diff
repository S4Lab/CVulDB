    PCI: don't use snprintf() in driver_override_show()
    
    Quote from Documentation/filesystems/sysfs.txt:
    
      show() must not use snprintf() when formatting the value to be
      returned to user space. If you can guarantee that an overflow
      will never happen you can use sprintf() otherwise you must use
      scnprintf().
    
    Commit 4efe874aace5 ("PCI: Don't read past the end of sysfs
    "driver_override" buffer") introduced such a snprintf() usage from
    driver_override_show() while at the same time tweaking
    driver_override_store() such that the write buffer can't ever get
    overflowed.
    
    Propogated from OMR1
    Mot-CRs-fixed: (CR)
    CVE-fixed: CVE-2018-9415
    Bug: 69129004
    
    Reasoning:
    Since aforementioned commit, driver_override_store() only accepts to be
    written buffers less than PAGE_SIZE - 1 in size.
    
    The then kstrndup()'ed driver_override string will be at most PAGE_SIZE - 1
    in length, including the trailing '\0'.
    
    After the addition of a '\n' in driver_override_show(), the result won't
    exceed PAGE_SIZE characters in length, again including the trailing '\0'.
    
    Hence, snprintf(buf, PAGE_SIZE, ...) and sprintf(buf, ...) are equivalent
    at this point.
    
    Replace the former by the latter in order to adhere to the rules in
    Documentation/filesystems/sysfs.txt.
    
    This is a style fix only and there's no change in functionality.
