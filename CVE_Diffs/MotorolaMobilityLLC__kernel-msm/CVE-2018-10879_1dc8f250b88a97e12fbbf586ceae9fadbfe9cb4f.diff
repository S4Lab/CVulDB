    ext4: always verify the magic number in xattr blocks
    
    If there an inode points to a block which is also some other type of
    metadata block (such as a block allocation bitmap), the
    buffer_verified flag can be set when it was validated as that other
    metadata block type; however, it would make a really terrible external
    attribute block.  The reason why we use the verified flag is to avoid
    constantly reverifying the block.  However, it doesn't take much
    overhead to make sure the magic number of the xattr block is correct,
    and this will avoid potential crashes.
    
    This addresses CVE-2018-10879.
