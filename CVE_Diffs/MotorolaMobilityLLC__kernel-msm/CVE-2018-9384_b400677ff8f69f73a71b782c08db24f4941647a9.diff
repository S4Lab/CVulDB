    BACKPORT: arm64: thread_info remove stale items
    
    We have a comment claiming __switch_to() cares about where cpu_context
    is located relative to cpu_domain in thread_info. However arm64 has
    never had a thread_info::cpu_domain field, and neither __switch_to nor
    cpu_switch_to care where the cpu_context field is relative to others.
    
    Additionally, the init_thread_info alias is never used anywhere in the
    kernel, and will shortly become problematic when thread_info is moved
    into task_struct.
    
    This patch removes both.

    This is a modification of Mark Rutland's original patch.
    arch/arm64/kernel/setup.c has been modified to use ttbr0 according to
    whether or not CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK is used. init_thread_info is
    removed only if CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK is not used.
