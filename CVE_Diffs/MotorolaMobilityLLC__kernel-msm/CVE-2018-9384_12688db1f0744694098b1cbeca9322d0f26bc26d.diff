    UPSTREAM: arm64: unexport walk_stackframe
    
    The walk_stackframe functions is architecture-specific, with a varying
    prototype, and common code should not use it directly. None of its
    current users can be built as modules. With THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK, users
    will also need to hold a stack reference before calling it.
    
    There's no reason for it to be exported, and it's very easy to misuse,
    so unexport it for now.
