    futex-prevent-requeue-pi-on-same-futex.patch futex: Forbid uaddr == uaddr2 in futex_requeue(..., requeue_pi=1)
    
    If uaddr == uaddr2, then we have broken the rule of only requeueing from
    a non-pi futex to a pi futex with this call.  If we attempt this, then
    dangling pointers may be left for rt_waiter resulting in an exploitable
    condition.
    
    This change brings futex_requeue() in line with futex_wait_requeue_pi()
    which performs the same check as per commit 6f7b0a2a5c0f ("futex: Forbid
    uaddr == uaddr2 in futex_wait_requeue_pi()")
    
    [ tglx: Compare the resulting keys as well, as uaddrs might be
            different depending on the mapping ]
    
    Fixes CVE-2014-3153.
