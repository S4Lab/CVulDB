    UPSTREAM: arm64: smp: prepare for smp_processor_id() rework
    
    Subsequent patches will make smp_processor_id() use a percpu variable.
    This will make smp_processor_id() dependent on the percpu offset, and
    thus we cannot use smp_processor_id() to figure out what to initialise
    the offset to.
    
    Prepare for this by initialising the percpu offset based on
    current::cpu, which will work regardless of how smp_processor_id() is
    implemented. Also, make this relationship obvious by placing this code
    together at the start of secondary_start_kernel().
