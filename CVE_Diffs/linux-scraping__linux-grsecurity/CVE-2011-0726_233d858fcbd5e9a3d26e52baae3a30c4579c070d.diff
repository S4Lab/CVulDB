    proc: protect mm start_code/end_code in /proc/pid/stat
    
    commit 5883f57ca0008ffc93e09cbb9847a1928e50c6f3 upstream.
    
    While mm->start_stack was protected from cross-uid viewing (commit
    f83ce3e6b02d5 ("proc: avoid information leaks to non-privileged
    processes")), the start_code and end_code values were not.  This would
    allow the text location of a PIE binary to leak, defeating ASLR.
    
    Note that the value "1" is used instead of "0" for a protected value since
    "ps", "killall", and likely other readers of /proc/pid/stat, take
    start_code of "0" to mean a kernel thread and will misbehave.  Thanks to
    Brad Spengler for pointing this out.
