    TTY: do not update atime/mtime on read/write
    
    commit b0de59b5733d18b0d1974a060860a8b5c1b36a2e upstream.
    
    On http://vladz.devzero.fr/013_ptmx-timing.php, we can see how to find
    out length of a password using timestamps of /dev/ptmx. It is
    documented in "Timing Analysis of Keystrokes and Timing Attacks on
    SSH". To avoid that problem, do not update time when reading
    from/writing to a TTY.
    
    I am afraid of regressions as this is a behavior we have since 0.97
    and apps may expect the time to be current, e.g. for monitoring
    whether there was a change on the TTY. Now, there is no change. So
    this would better have a lot of testing before it goes upstream.
