    wait_task_stopped: Check p->exit_state instead of TASK_TRACED (CVE-2007-5500)
    
    patch a3474224e6a01924be40a8255636ea5522c1023a in mainline
    
    The original meaning of the old test (p->state > TASK_STOPPED) was
    "not dead", since it was before TASK_TRACED existed and before the
    state/exit_state split.  It was a wrong correction in commit
    14bf01bb0599c89fc7f426d20353b76e12555308 to make this test for
    TASK_TRACED instead.  It should have been changed when TASK_TRACED
    was introducted and again when exit_state was introduced.
