    [PATCH] SCTP: Allow spillover of receive buffer to avoid deadlock. (CVE-2006-2275)
    
    This patch fixes a deadlock situation in the receive path by allowing
    temporary spillover of the receive buffer.
    
    - If the chunk we receive has a tsn that immediately follows the ctsn,
      accept it even if we run out of receive buffer space and renege data with
      higher TSNs.
    - Once we accept one chunk in a packet, accept all the remaining chunks
      even if we run out of receive buffer space.
