    i9300: disable samsung_extdisp driver and regenerate defconfig
    
    The samsung_extdisp driver for GT-I9500 was affected by CVE-2015-1800 and
    CVE-2015-1801. The Galaxy S3 uses an older version of this driver and is at
    least affected by CVE-2015-1801. Newer kernel versions for the GT-I9500
    had the driver completely removed. I also found no indication that the
    driver is actually needed for the S3, so let's disable it.
